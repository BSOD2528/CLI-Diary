A simple diary entry program using python and postgresql. The following showcase it's features :


- Privacy for each user via log - in methods, etc.
- Multiple users can journal entries
- Add, Edit and Remove entries

NOTE : Multiple User accessability is still buggy. Please do be patient until then. Thank you!

## Setup :

Ensure a PostgreSQL Server is setup. It can be done either locally or via a remote connection. Then clone the repository on your terminal :

```py
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Utilise the [**example.env**](example.env) for making a .`.env` for loading up all the credentials.

```py
python3 <file_name>
```
